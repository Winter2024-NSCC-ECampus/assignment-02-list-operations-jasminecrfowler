# Linked List Operations

This Java project demonstrates various operations on a linked list. It implements the following functionalities:

## Features

1. **Insertion Operations:**
   - Insert a node at the beginning of the list.
   - Insert a node at the end of the list.
   - Insert a node at the correct location in a sorted list.

2. **Deletion Operations:**
   - Delete the first node of the list.
   - Delete the last node of the list.
   - Delete a node at a given index.

3. **Splitting a List:**
   - Split a list into two sublists. If the number of elements is odd, the extra element goes into the front list.

4. **Merging Two Sorted Lists:**
   - Sort two lists independently and merge them into a single sorted list.

## Example Output 

Initial Sorted List:
2 -> 3 -> 5 -> 7 -> 11 -> null
After deleting first:
3 -> 5 -> 7 -> 11 -> null
After deleting last:
3 -> 5 -> 7 -> null
After deleting at index 1:
3 -> 7 -> null
Front List:
3 -> null
Back List:
7 -> null
Merged Sorted List:
1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> null
